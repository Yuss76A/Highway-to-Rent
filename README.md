#### User Stories Information

* Initially, I outlined high-level user stories to guide the overall structure and features of the project, focusing on the main functionalities users would need. As I progressed, I created more detailed, specific user stories in GitHub to break down those broader goals into actionable tasks and edge cases, helping to refine the development process and ensure a thorough understanding of each component.

### Agile Aproach

The project was organized with associated user stories and tasks using GitHub Projects. You can find the project at [Car Rental booking App] (https://github.com/users/Yuss76A/projects/10/views/1).

* Here, you can see the user stories that I previously shared, but in a more detailed form, which were developed from those initial stories. Up to user story number 9, they mainly focused on the backend functionalities. Additionally, I created stories related to the frontend, which are explicitly labeled as "front end" in the titles. I included these front-end stories to ensure I didn’t forget any important aspects during the development process, even if some of them might overlap with the backend stories. This way, I aimed to cover all the key features and avoid missing anything crucial while building the project.
